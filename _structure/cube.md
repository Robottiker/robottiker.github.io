# Structure
The basic structure is made out of 3m x 3m cube shaped frame, that can be mounted and dismantled easily by two persons with simple tools. The cubes can be combined on all sides, to construct individual spaces. With a maximum of two cubes stacked on top of each other (2 floors). The floor, walls and roof are made out of prefabricated panels (components). The combination of the frame and the panels provides a dynamic system that can build completely personalized spaces, that are cheap, safe and look visually attractive.  
# Foundation
The foundation of the “legs” can be removed and is specifically build for mobile structures. The legs touch the ground only on certain points and thus have a minimal impact on the ground.

# Components
All the basic needs for a person to live healthy and safe are provided, through easy mountable and replaceable components. In the future more of those components will be developed, for example a hydroponic farming system. Inside of some components sensors are used to collect realtime data to improve, adjust and automate the system. A custom built software platform connects components over a settlement wide network. On this platform we’ll develop applications, that can interact and orchestrate the components.
